# Overview
This project is a collection of all my classifier algorithms, created from a blend of assignments and  passsion projects. They're designed to be both a learning tool and a practical resource for tackling classification tasks with precision. I commented everything extensively to sharpen my own understanding. I hope you can learn from my learning

# Features
## Trained Models: 
These models are ready for deployment. the minimum acceptable accuracy benchmark I put for myself was 95
## Datasets: 
Opensource Datasets I used for training my models, feel free to replace with your own, 
## Untrained Algorithms:
The underlying code behind my models, well commented and well explained I hope.
# Getting Started
Prepare algo by:
  ### Installating
    git clone [https://github.com/ArvinSefidi/Classification-Algorithms]
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ### Contribution
  Your insights can help my learning and optimize code. Let me know how to improve
